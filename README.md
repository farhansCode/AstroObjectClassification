# StarGalaxyQSOClassification

This machine learning project uses light data to classify stars, galaxies, and QSOs (quasi-stellar objects).  
The project contains a CSV file and a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Contents

- `StarGalaxyQSOClassification.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `data.csv` – Dataset containing labeled photometric data.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Run all cells in order.  
   Note: The full execution takes approximately 25 minutes.

## What I Learned

- Data cleaning  
- Feature scaling  
- Identifying outliers  
- Multiple machine learning models  
- Decision trees  
- SVM kernels
